19.03.2021: Rhialto
        version 0.7:
        - Fixed the end-of-line check for MARK, EMT, TRAP.
        - Left/right shift operator _; disabled when the -yus option is used.
          Contributed by Stephen Casner.
        - Added some missing instructions: LDCFD, CSM, TSTSET, WRTLCK.

13.02.2021: Rhialto
        version 0.6:
        - Fixed rounding issues with floating point literals.
        - Fixed FPP instructions which take fp immediate operands.
        - Fixed bounds check on FPP AC0-3 operands.
        - Fix listing to show a % before values that represent a register
          number.
        - Added checks for junk text following correct code. This revealed
          some small other issues, now fixed.
        - Added CIS instructions; as an extension, for the Inline variants
          you can specify the descriptor addresses etc as arguments to
          the instruction (much like an implied .word).

25.04.2020: Rhialto
        version 0.5:
        - Fixed bug with checking addressing mode for JSR and bugs
          with .REPT 0, unneeded relocation on pc-relative mode.
        - Very simple .LIST and .NLIST implementation.
        - Add ^pl and ^ph expressions from 2.11BSD's m11.
        - Object-ified macro libraries with an eye to support the .sml
          files from 2.11BSD's m11. But since the given file does not 
          just contain .MACROs (it even contains conditionals) I'm not
          sure how it is supposed to work.
        - Added 2.11BSD/m11 as test files. To make this reasonable, a
          few small features they use have been recognized and ignored.
        - Add -rsx and -rt11 to switch object file format (from Kevin Handy)
        - Add obj2bin from https://github.com/AK6DN/obj2bin.git

09.11.2015: Rhialto
        version 0.4:
        - Fixed various bugs. The most notable was extensive use-
          after-free in the expression tree, which crashed on NetBSD but
          apparently not on other  systems.
        - Lots of changes to make this MACRO11 more like the MACRO11 of
          RSX-11M+ 4.6. I used Kermit-11 source files for comparison.
          "The Manual" I'm refering to is
          AA-KX10A-TC_PDP-11_MACRO-11_Reference_Manual_May88.pdf at
          www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/rsx11/RSX11Mplus_V4.x/4a/ and
          I use an installed system to double-check.

        version 0.3
        - bugfix: Illegal labels and illegal opcodes are processed as
          "implied .WORD" directives.
          Expression errors in "do_word()" did not process any input character,
          so parser did go into an endless loop.
        - Switchable syntax extensions with -yxx options:
          symbol len can be adjusted with "-ysl" command line option.
          "-yus" option allows underscore "_" char in symbols.
          This was needed to process code generated by my favorite disassembler.
        - command line help added (-h option)

17.4.2009: JH
        version 0.3
        - ".INCLUDE" re-enabled
        - refactoring: big 6000+ lines "macro11.c" split into 10 modules.

        mlb.c for portability
        fixed a type cast warning in dumpobj.c compare_gsdlines
        Removed strcasecmp from macro11.c for portability
        Removed references to wnewmem.c from makefile (isn't needed)
        makefile more compatible with non-gnu make and compiler
        main prints version 0.2
