This is the Jim Reeds version of the Harvard m11.

Here is code for 2 programs:

	m11	the assembler itself		many .m11 source files
						and the include file 'at.sml'
	macxrf	crossreference generator	macxrf.c

There are two documentation files:

	m11.1		nroff -man'able version of a manual page
	Document	nroff -ms'able version of a DRAFT of a windy document

To install:

	You must put macxrf into /usr/ucb/macxrf.  This path name is
buried in the m11 source file exec.m11 if you want to change it.  The assembler
itself can live anywhere.  /usr/new/m11 and /usr/ucb/m11 are two
likely places to put it.

	You might need a copy of the Jim Reeds souped up l11 to link this
program.  Source is in ../l11.  The changes involved with l11 are minor.

	Hints about using m11:  This version works differently from older
versions.  Many of the defaults are changed.  The most suprising is that
undefined sysmbols are automatically treated as external.  This is the
default .enabl gbl attribute.  Users can either do .dsabl gbl or use one of the
retrofit flags.  Here are the two retrofit flags:

	m11 -de args
	m11 -ha args

-de stands for DEC, -ha stands for Harvard.  Code written for DEC macro-11
should probably be assembled with the -de flag for DEC-like treatment of
case conversion, etc.  This includes the Johns Hopkins basic+ interpreter.
Code written for earlier versions of the Harvard Unixification of macro-11
should be assembled with the -ha flag.  This includes Harvard's absurd .psect
default attributes.  Use it when recreating Harvard lisp.
